# 3_joint_manip
This was my Foundations of Robotics project to control a 3 joint robot manipulator in Gazebo simulations

The fwd_k package solved forward kinematics for the robot, written in C++

The assignemnt 3 package was a service implmentation to solve velocity kinematics, apply PD control and send joint velocity commands to the robot, written in Python
